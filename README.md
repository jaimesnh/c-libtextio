# liblineutils

A simple C library for text stream processing that provides three functions similar to the UNIX commands `head`, `tail`, and `longlines`.  
This project is part of the **Operating Systems** course — *Software Engineering Degree, 2025–26*.

## 📄 Description

This library allows you to read text from the standard input and display:
- The **first N lines** (`head`)
- The **last N lines** (`tail`)
- The **N longest lines** (`longlines`)

It is designed as a reusable C library (`.a` or `.so`) and includes a test program to verify and demonstrate its functionality.

### `int tail(int N)`

### `int longlines(int N)`
